Xinja is a 100-percent digital cloud-based neobank composed of a microservices architecture built with Kubernetes and Apache Kafka on AWS and hooked into many modern, cloud-based banking, payment, and channel platforms. This session focuses on how Xinja built its technology stack to exceed stringent security, risk, and resiliency requirements. Learn how it established a contemporary cloud network foundation, delivered transaction and deposit accounts with debit card payment capability, and integrated Apple Pay and Google Pay (including PCI DSS compliance). Additionally, hear how Xinja created multiple on-demand data pipelines and worked with APRA to secure its banking license and revolutionise its customersâ€™ banking experience.
