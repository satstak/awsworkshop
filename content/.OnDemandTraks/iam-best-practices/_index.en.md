AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) enables you to securely manage access to AWS services and resources. Using IAM, you can create and manage AWS users and groups, as well as use permissions to allow and deny their access to AWS resources. In this session, you learn best practices for managing user identity and permissions with AWS. We examine role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control (ABAC) models to ensure that people have the right access to what they need to perform their roles.
