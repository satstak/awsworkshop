Ensuring security and compliance is a shared responsibility between AWS and the customer. In this session, we introduce the AWS Shared Responsibility Model along with key security services that allow you to build security controls that are aligned to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework categories: identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover. You also hear from a financial institution in Singapore about how they are developing a cloud security strategy that allows innovation within defined risk guardrails.
