**Congratulations! You have now created a CloudTrail trail and added a CloudWatch log for the API activity in your AWS Account.**

### Turn on AWS Config
---
AWS Config provides a detailed view of the configuration of AWS resources in your AWS account. This includes how the resources are related to one another and how they were configured in the past so that you can see how the configurations and relationships change over time.

1. Open the **AWS Config** console.
2. Click on the **Get Started** button.
  * Leave all settings on their default choices and click on the **Next** button â€“ This will create an S3 bucket, a role for the Config service, and begin recording configuration history for resources in the account:

  * On the **AWS Config Rules** screen click on the **Next** button to skip selecting any AWS Config Rules for the moment.
  * On the **Review** screen click on the **Confirm** button.

**Congratulations!  AWS Config is now turned on in your account and is tracking configuration history.**
